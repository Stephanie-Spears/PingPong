#### By _**Stephanie Spears**_

## Description

  _**This project was created for Epicodus to fulfill the following objectives:**_

_Create a web application that takes a number from a user and returns a range of numbers from 1 to the chosen number with the following exceptions:_

_*Numbers divisible by 3 are replaced with "ping"*_
_**Numbers divisible by 5 are replaced with "pong"**_
* _Numbers divisible by 15 are replaced with "ping-pong"_
* _A user should be able to enter a new number and see new results over and over again._

_Break the program down into simple, individual behaviors with input/output examples. Begin with the simplest possible behavior. List these behaviors (also known as "specs" or "specifications") in the project's README.md file._

_**Your code will be reviewed for the following objectives:**_

_JavaScript business logic and user interface logic are separate._
_Variable names are descriptive and use lower camel case (e.g. myVariableExample)._
_Code has proper indentation and spacing._
_Application works as expected._
_All previous objectives have been met._
_Logic is broken down into "plain English" specs, listed in README._
_Project is in a presentable, portfolio-quality state._
_Required functionality is in place by Friday deadline._
_Project demonstrates understanding of this week's concepts. If prompted, you are able to discuss your code with an instructor using correct terminology._
